# cf-gym-helper
## Tired of spending too much time selecting unique problems for a codeforces mashup contest, this tool will do this automatically for you

### How to use
**Step1:** Dowload this folder locally(all 3 files should be in same folder)<br>
**Step2:** Open the handles.txt file and list handles of all participants you want to consider for mashup contest (each handle should be in it's own line, see the default file)<br>
**Step3:** Run the script, all the details will be asked interactively<br> 
**Step4:** Id of all the genearted problems along with the link will be copied to 'problems.txt' file<br><br>

**ps** Since there is limit to number of API requests that can be made to cf per second, program is slow. If number of participants is larger
you might have to wait a few minutes, (grab a coffee and watch the script in action)
